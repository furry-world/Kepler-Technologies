# Kepler K6 (1975)

## Overview

- 6-bit RISC CPU
    - 6-bit word = hyte (hex-byte)
- Harvard architecture (separate RAM and ROM)
    - 8-bit RAM address lines (256 hytes)
    - 12-bit ROM address lines (4096 hytes)
- Clock speed: TBD
- Registers:
    - 12-bit program counter (PC)
    - 4-bit stack pointer (SP)
        - Stack is used exclusively for storing return addresses
    - 7 6-bit general-purpose registers (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
        - K6 has an additional output pin that signals write operations to G, it can be used for I/O purposes
        - All of these registers are readable externally when execution is paused
    - 1-bit register (H, holds carry bit)
- Starts execution from the start of ROM (program memory)

## Assembly notation
All instructions follow this format:
```
NAME [parameter 1] [parameter 2]
```
NAME describes the opcode mnemonic, while parameters can be either memory addresses, registers or immediate values, as described by the particular opcode.

Addresses and immediate values are distinguished by appending `#` in case of an immediate value, as shown below:
```
LOAD A $01      ; loads value from address $01 into register A
LOAD A #$01     ; loads immediate value $01 into register A
```

### Number radices
Recommended radices are as follows:
- 8 (for immediate values)
- 16 (for addresses)

Numbers are assumed to be decimal unless otherwise noted. Alternative number radices are notated by prefixing the following characters to the value itself:
- `%` = 2 (binary system)
- `!` = 8 (octal system)
- `$` = 16 (hexadecimal system)

## Code control instructions

### JUMP
#### Syntax:
```
JUMP <address>
```
#### Description:
Sets the program counter to the specified value, and continues execution from there.

### RJUMP (Relative JUMP)
#### Syntax:
```
RJUMP <hytes>
```
#### Description:
Adds the specified value to the program counter, and continues execution from there.

### CALL
#### Syntax:
```
CALL <address>
```
#### Description:
Pushes the current address to the stack (least significant hyte first), then sets the program counter to the specified value, and continues execution from there.

### RETURN
#### Syntax:
```
RETURN
```
#### Description:
Pops the previous address from the stack (most significant hyte first), then sets the program counter to the specified value, and continues execution from there.

## Branching, comparison

### EQUAL
#### Syntax:
```
EQUAL <register 1> <register 2 or memory address>
```
#### Description:
Tests the two specified locations for equality. If the test is true, the next instruction is skipped and the instruction takes as many extra cycles as the skipped instruction has hytes of length.

### NOTEQUAL
#### Syntax:
```
NOTEQUAL <register 1> <register 2 or memory address>
```
#### Description:
Tests the two specified locations for non-equality. If the test is true, the next instruction is skipped and the instruction takes as many extra cycles as the skipped instruction has hytes of length.

## Reading, writing
### LOAD
#### Syntax:
```
LOAD <register 1> <register 2, memory address or immediate value>
```
#### Description:
Loads the value in the specified register, value at the specified memory address or an immediate value into the specified register. In the case of loading an immediate value, the top two bits of a byte are discarded, and only the bottom six bits (the entire last hyte) are used.

### STORE
#### Syntax:
```
STORE <register> <memory address>
```
#### Description:
Stores the value in the specified register at the specified memory address.

### PLOAD (Program LOAD)
#### Syntax:
```
PLOAD <register> <memory address>
```
#### Description:
Loads the value at the specified program memory address into the specified register.

### PSTORE (Program STORE)
#### Syntax:
```
PSTORE <register> <memory address>
```
#### Description:
Stores the value in the specified register at the specified program memory address.
> NOTE: On systems where program memory is stored in read-only memory, this instruction will do nothing.

## Arithmetic and logical instructions

### ADD
#### Syntax:
```
ADD <register 1> <register 2>
```
#### Description:
Sums the values of the two specified registers. The result is stored in the first specified register. If the result is bigger than `!77`, the carry flag in the H register is set. Otherwise, it is clear.

### SUBTRACT
#### Syntax:
```
SUBTRACT <register 1> <register 2>
```
#### Description:
Subtracts the value of second register from the value of the first. The result is stored in the first specified register. If the result is a negative number, the carry flag in the H register is set. Otherwise, it is clear.
> NOTE: Subtraction, together with register H can also be used to compare two values.

### OR
#### Syntax:
```
OR <register 1> <register 2>
```
#### Description:
Performs a bitwise OR operation between the values of the two specified registers. The result is stored in the first specified register.

### AND
#### Syntax:
```
AND <register 1> <register 2>
```
#### Description:
Performs a bitwise AND operation between the values of the two specified registers. The result is stored in the first specified register.

### XOR
#### Syntax:
```
XOR <register 1> <register 2>
```
#### Description:
Performs a bitwise XOR operation between the values of the two specified registers. The result is stored in the first specified register.
> NOTE: A bitwise NOT is achievable by loading a value of `!77` into the second register, then calling the XOR instruction.

### SHIFTL
#### Syntax:
```
SHIFTL <register>
```
#### Description:
Shifts the value inside the specified register one bit left. The top bit is stored in the carry bit of register H.

### SHIFTR
#### Syntax:
```
SHIFTR <register>
```
#### Description:
Shifts the value inside the specified register one bit right. The top bit is derived from the carry bit of register H.
